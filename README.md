My first android project as a submission for dicoding academy. This project was a simple one. I only needed to load items from arraylist into recyclerview and made a detail page for each of those items.

Here are the main things that i learned to use in this project:
- Arraylist
- Recyclerview
- Support library like glide from bumptech
